# frontend-project

This is the work I created for my Front-End Application Project.

This website was made to give users the ability to see current Formula 1 season information in
a clean, easy to read format. This website uses Ergast API to fetch data from the current season
as it continues. The website is serverless using raw HTML and CSS as well as Javascript and JQuery.

See my work @ https://f1databaseapp.netlify.app/about.html

This page has an expanded BlogPost section which has not been migrated to work together quite yet.
My plan is to return to these projects and expand their capabilities with the things I learn during
my immersive. If you're a Formula 1 fan, I hope you find this app useful!
